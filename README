 SETUP
=======

All of the following instructions are for Ubuntu (12.04+). Paths might be
different on your distribution

1. Set up a new mime type (text/x-pinpoint) for pinpoint files (*.pin)

cp x-pinpoint.xml ~/.local/share/mime/packages/
update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime

2. Copy the highlighter file to the appropriate location
cp pinpoint.lang ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/

* To users of Fedora Linux the appropriate location is /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/

3. Close all gedit windows 

4. Open any .pin file in gedit and enjoy syntax highlighting.
